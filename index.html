        <p> My career interest is in Cybersecurity. Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks or damage.
        In today's society where we are all interconnected, and rely heavily on technology for communication, business and storing sensitive information, this is why the cybersecurity is so important in this day and age, to safeguard information. Cybersecurity involves the use of tools, techniques and best practices to safeguard information against threats such as phishing, malware, hacking, and data breaches. Not only focusing on technology, cybersecurity also emphasizes awareness and responsible online behavior, making it a crucial discipline for ensuring privacy, trust, and safety in this digital age.</p>
